# Common Questions About Your Final Project 🤔

## Project Setup & Organization 📁

### Files and Naming
Q: Should we rename the CSV file to something simpler, or keep the original name?  
A: Keep the original name! If it describes what's in the file, that's perfect. Clear names help you and others understand your project better. 😊

Q: When saving our Python file, should we use main.py or a custom name?  
A: For this project, let's use main.py - it keeps things simple and consistent for everyone! 👍

### GitHub
Q: When we make the GitHub repo, should it be public or private?  
A: Make it public! Share your awesome work with the world. Plus, it's great to start building your portfolio early! 🌟

Q: How often should we commit our code to GitHub?  
A: Try to commit at the end of each day's work. Think of it like saving a checkpoint in a video game - you'll thank yourself later! 🎮

Q: Do we need to back up our code somewhere besides GitHub?  
A: Nope, GitHub's got you covered for this project! It's like having a super-reliable backup friend. 💪

## Programming & Implementation 💻

### Error Handling
Q: For first-time error handling, should we start with simple things like checking if files exist?  
A: Absolutely! Start with the basics and build up from there. It's like learning to walk before you run! 🚶‍♂️ -> 🏃‍♂️

Q: Do we need to handle both file not found AND file format errors?  
A: Just focus on file not found errors for now. You're learning something new, and it's totally okay to start small! 📚

Q: Should we add error handling for mathematical operations like division by zero?  
A: Yes, that's a great idea! It shows you're thinking ahead about what could go wrong - that's what great programmers do! 🧮

### User Interface
Q: Can we use emojis in our interface to make it more friendly?  
A: Yes! Have fun with it! Emojis can make your program more engaging and fun to use. 🎨

Q: For menu options, is it better to use numbers (1,2,3) or letters (a,b,c)?  
A: Let's use numbers for this project - they're super clear and easy for users to understand! 🔢

Q: Should we convert any string inputs to lowercase when comparing them?  
A: Yes! That's a really thoughtful way to make your program more user-friendly. Whether someone types "EXIT" or "exit", they mean the same thing, right? 😉

## Code Organization & Style 📝

### Functions and Structure
Q: Should we create separate functions for each menu option?  
A: Yes! It's like organizing your room - when everything has its place, life is much easier! 🏠

Q: Should we put all the print statements for the menu in one function or split them up?  
A: Either way works! Do what makes the most sense to you - that's part of learning to be a programmer! 🤓

### Documentation
Q: How many comments is "too many" comments?  
A: The docstrings and your current level of comments are great! Think of comments like helpful signs on a road - you want enough to guide the way, but not so many that they're distracting! 🚦

Q: Should we write documentation as we go or all at once at the end?  
A: Write it as you go! It's like taking notes in class - much easier to do it in the moment than trying to remember everything later! ✏️

## Data Analysis & Visualization 📊

### Analysis
Q: Should we calculate statistics (like averages, counts) for different categories in our data?  
A: Yes! That's a smart way to understand patterns in your data. You're thinking like a data scientist! 🔬

Q: When showing numerical results, should we round the numbers? If so, to how many decimal places?  
A: Let's use 2 decimal places - it keeps things neat and readable! Finding the right balance between precision and readability is important. 😄

Q: Should we analyze relationships between different columns in our dataset?  
A: Yes! Looking for connections in your data can lead to interesting discoveries. Just make sure the relationships you're analyzing make sense for your specific dataset! 🤓

### Visualization
Q: Are there recommended sizes for different types of plots?  
A: Play around with different sizes! It's like being an artist - try different things and see what makes your data look clearest and most beautiful! 🎨

Q: For colors, should we use default colors or pick our own?  
A: You can pick your own! Have fun with it! If you're not sure what colors work well together, try using a color palette generator - they're super helpful! 🌈

Q: Which type of plot should I use for my data?
A: That depends on what you're trying to show! Check out the visualization guide to learn about different plot types and when to use each one. Think about what would make your data easiest to understand! 📈

## Testing & Debug 🐛

Q: Should we test with both good and bad user inputs?  
A: Yes! Try both! It's like testing a game - you want to make sure it works even when someone does something unexpected! 🎮

Q: How can we test our error handling without breaking our program?  
A: Don't worry if you find inputs that break your program - that's actually helpful! It shows you where you can make your program even better. We'll learn all about proper testing next term! 🔨

## PEP8 & Style Guide ✨

Q: Is there a tool that can check if we're following PEP8 correctly?  
A: For this project, we'll check manually - it's good practice for understanding the rules! Think of it like proofreading your own writing. 📝

Q: When following PEP8, do we need to fix all our existing code or just new code?  
A: All of it! Think of it like keeping your whole room clean, not just the new stuff you bring in! 🧹

## Practice & Learning 📚

Q: Can we practice matplotlib and seaborn on small example data before using our real dataset?  
A: Yes! That's a fantastic idea! It's like practicing with training wheels before tackling the big bike - super smart approach! 🚲
