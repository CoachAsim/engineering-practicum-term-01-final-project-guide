## Core Programming Concepts
The following concepts must be demonstrated in your project:

1. Data Types and Variables
2. Expressions and Statements
3. Terminal I/O
4. Conditionals and Boolean Expressions
5. Lists and List Operations
6. String Operations
7. For and While Loops
8. Functions with Parameters

## Quick Start Guide

1. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. Create project structure:
   ```
   your_project/
   ├── README.md
   ├── main.py
   └── data/
   ```

3. Follow the timeline in `03-timeline.md`

4. Use the checklist in `10-completion-checklist.md` to self-assess

## Additional Support
I wish that for everyone one of you there was one of me but unfortunately that ratio is 1:16. So! I am using Large Language Model AI tools to help all of us : )

You can use the Large Language Model of your choice (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT) to coach you through your project like I would!

Here are the constraints though:
1. You MUST use the exact prompt in this document to initiate the chat (ask me if you want to change it): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fJt1DWv3nH4Ix1Eo6VGILbftq_LgK6l1rFzPOSkhoeI/edit?usp=sharing
- Basically, this prompt sets you up to be able to get support, learn and improve you skills and understanding without just being given the answers (working code).

2. You have to download and attach this document to your prompt: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KTrM8X539Gcf86KVkwVVSh8awU8JitkTw1Bl0eZJd_E/edit?usp=sharing
- This contains the full project guide in one doc. DO NOT copy paste this into the LLMs chat box. It's to much text for that 📚

3. Do not give it information about yourself that you wouldn't want to share publicly on the internet.

## Questions or Issues?
Refer to the appropriate document or ask for clarification from your instructor.
