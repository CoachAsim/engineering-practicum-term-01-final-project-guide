# Project Timeline

The timeline below helps you incrementally build your interactive data analysis project, ensuring you implement all required programming concepts while maintaining focus on your chosen topic.

These times are just guides, not absolute time limits ‚è±Ô∏è Don't rush yourself, its just good to begin to get a gauge on how long it takes you to do things. As always, with practice, things that used to take an hour can eventually take 5 minutes üòé

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Planning & Setup (1.5 hours)
- Choose project focus (15 min)

## Time Management Tips

### Dividing Your 1.5 Hours
For each coding session:
- First 10 minutes: Review previous work and plan today's tasks
- Next 70 minutes: Main development work
- Last 10 minutes: Document what you did and plan for tomorrow

### Staying on Track
- Set a timer for your 1.5-hour session
- Keep your README updated as you go
- Comment your code while writing it
- If you get stuck, spend max 20 minutes before asking for help
