## Core Components
Building from the examples in the introduction, your project must demonstrate mastery of fundamental programming concepts while performing meaningful data analysis. Your project must include:

### Programming Component
- Implementation of fundamental programming concepts:
  - Data types (int, float, str, bool) with proper type conversion
  - Variables following PEP8 naming conventions
  - Expressions and statements with clear arithmetic operations
  - Interactive terminal I/O with user input and formatted output
  - Conditional statements and boolean expressions
  - List operations including creation, modification, and list comprehension
  - String operations including formatting and string methods
  - Both for loops and while loops for data processing
  - Functions with proper documentation and parameters
- Error handling for user input and file operations
- Clear code comments and documentation following PEP8

### Data Analysis Component
- Interactive data loading and cleaning
  - User input for analysis parameters
  - Command-line interface for data exploration
  - Error handling for data validation
- Basic statistical analysis incorporating:
  - Loops for data processing
  - List operations for data manipulation
  - Conditional logic for data filtering
- At least two different types of visualizations
- Interactive results presentation
- Written analysis of findings

### Documentation
- Flow diagram of main algorithm
- Step-by-step algorithm description
- Pseudocode
- Code comments
- README file
- Analysis report

### Extension Options 
- Classes for object-oriented design
- HTML & CSS interface
- Advanced data structures
- Additional visualizations
- Complex error handling
