# üôåüèæ Engineering Practicum: Term 1 - Final Project üôåüèæ

## Overview
Congratulations on a reaching the final project of Engineering Practicum Term 1 üéâüéâüéâ

During this 7-day project (1.5 hours each day), you'll create an interactive program that analyzes real data related to your aspirations as a Technologist! While your finished project may not yet solve global challenges, it will demonstrate how programming and data analysis can be used to understand and address important problems üåé

## Project Scope
- Total time: 7 days √ó 1.5 hours = 10.5 hours total
- One Python file (main.py) containing all code
- Analysis of one dataset
- At least two visualizations
- Clear documentation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è I recommend that you keep your intial ideas relatively simple üôèüèæ You can always add more ontop of a simple project if you have more time üòé Which is better than getting overwhelmed with a complex project ü´∂üèæ
