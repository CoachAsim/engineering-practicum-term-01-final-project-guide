# High School Computer Science Final Project Guide

## Overview
During this 7-day project (1.5 hours each day), you'll create an interactive program that analyzes real data related to your interests. While your finished project won't solve global challenges, it will demonstrate how programming and data analysis can be used to understand and address important problems.

### Interactive Data Analysis Example
Let's look at a concrete example of how you can make your data analysis interactive and engaging:

#### Music Listening Habits Analyzer
Build a program that:
- Loads music listening data (artist, song, duration, time of day)
- Lets users explore their listening habits through an interactive menu
- Creates visualizations based on user choices

Example Interactive Session:
```
=== Music Listening Analysis ===
Welcome! What would you like to explore?
1. Find my top artists
2. Analyze listening times
3. Discover song patterns
4. Generate listening report
Choice: 1

How many top artists would you like to see? 5

Top 5 Artists by Listening Time:
1. Taylor Swift (45 hours)
2. The Weeknd (38 hours)
3. Drake (33 hours)
4. Ariana Grande (30 hours)
5. Ed Sheeran (28 hours)

Would you like to:
1. See more details about an artist
2. Visualize this as a chart
3. Go back to main menu
Choice: 1

Enter artist number (1-5): 1

Taylor Swift Listening Analysis:
- Most played song: "Anti-Hero"
- Peak listening hour: 2pm
- Favorite day: Saturday
- Average song duration: 3.5 minutes

Press Enter to continue...
```

## Project Scope
- Total time: 7 days Ã— 1.5 hours = 10.5 hours total
- One Python file (main.py) containing all code
- Analysis of one dataset
- At least two visualizations
- Clear documentation

## Example Projects

### For Clean Water Access Interest
Build a program that:
- Analyzes water quality data across different regions
- Creates visualizations showing access to clean water by location
- Calculates key statistics about water quality metrics
- Identifies areas most in need of clean water infrastructure

Example Features:
- Load and clean water quality datasets
- Create maps or charts showing water access patterns
- Calculate important metrics like population without access
- Generate reports highlighting critical areas
