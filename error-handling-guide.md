## What Is Error Handling? ü§î

Think about ordering food at a restaurant:

- You ask for a burger
- BUT what if they're out of burgers?
- Instead of panicking, the waiter tells you they're out and asks what else you'd like

That's basically what error handling is in your program:

- Your program tries to do something
- If something goes wrong
- Instead of crashing, it tells the user what happened and what to do next

## Understanding try/except - Your Program's Safety Net! ü•Ö

### What is try/except?

Think of `try/except` like this:
- `try`: "Hey program, TRY to do this thing"
- `except`: "If it doesn't work, here's what to do instead"

It's like having a backup plan:

```python
# Without a backup plan:
"Hey, catch this ball!"
# If you miss, you might get hit! üò´

# With a backup plan (try/except):
"Hey, try to catch this ball!"      # try
"If you miss, dodge out of the way" # except
```

### Basic Structure:

```python
try:
    # Put the thing you want to try here
    # If it works, great!
except:
    # Put your backup plan here
    # This runs if the try part fails
```

### Real Example:

```python
# Try to convert user input to a number
try:
    age = int(input("What's your age? "))
    print(f"Cool, you're {age} years old!")
except:
    print("Oops! That's not a number!")
```

## When to Use Different Methods ü§î

### Use if/else and loops when:

1. You can CHECK something BEFORE it might cause a problem
2. You want to PREVENT errors from happening
3. You're dealing with user CHOICES or MENU OPTIONS

Example - Good Menu Choice Handling:

```python
def get_menu_choice():
    while True:
        print("\n1. Analyze Data")
        print("2. Show Chart")
        print("3. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Pick a number: ")
        
        if choice in ['1', '2', '3']:
            return choice
        else:
            print("Please enter 1, 2, or 3!")
```

### Use try/except when:

1. You can only find out if something will work by TRYING it
2. You're dealing with things that might FAIL even if they look correct
3. You're working with FILES or converting STRINGS TO NUMBERS

Example - Good Number Input Handling:

```python
def get_user_age():
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
            if age < 0 or age > 150:  # Use if/else for range checking
                print("Age must be between 0 and 150!")
                continue
            return age
        except:
            print("Please enter a number!")
```

## Common Error Handling Examples üìù

### 1. Loading Data Files

```python
def load_my_data():
    try:
        data = pd.read_csv("my_data.csv")
        print(f"Found {len(data)} rows of data!")
        return data
    except:
        print("Couldn't load the data file!")
        print("Make sure 'my_data.csv' is in your folder!")
        return None
```

### 2. Getting Number Inputs

```python
def get_number_from_user():
    while True:
        try:
            num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
            return num
        except:
            print("That's not a number! Try again.")
```

### 3. Menu Selection

```python
def show_menu():
    while True:
        print("\nWhat would you like to do?")
        print("1. Show first 5 rows")
        print("2. Show basic stats")
        print("3. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Your choice: ")
        
        if choice in ['1', '2', '3']:
            return choice
        print("Please enter 1, 2, or 3!")
```

## Adding Error Handling to Your Project üöÄ

Here's a complete example putting it all together:

```python
def analyze_data():
    # Step 1: Load the data safely
    try:
        data = pd.read_csv("my_data.csv")
        print("Data loaded successfully!")
    except:
        print("Couldn't find the data file!")
        return  # Exit if we can't load the data
    
    while True:
        # Step 2: Show menu and get choice
        print("\nWhat would you like to analyze?")
        print("1. First 5 rows")
        print("2. Basic stats")
        print("3. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Your choice: ")
        
        if choice == '3':
            print("Thanks for using the program!")
            break
        
        if choice not in ['1', '2']:
            print("Please enter 1, 2, or 3!")
            continue
        
        # Step 3: Show results based on choice
        if choice == '1':
            print("\nHere are the first 5 rows:")
            print(data.head())
        else:
            print("\nHere are the basic stats:")
            print(data.describe())
```

## Tips and Best Practices üí™

### 1. When to Use Each Method

Use if/else and loops for:
- Menu choices (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Yes/no questions (y/n)
- Checking if a number is too big or small
- Checking if a string is empty

Use try/except for:
- Loading files
- Converting strings to numbers
- Math operations that might fail
- Anything that needs to be TRIED to know if it works

### 2. Making Good Error Messages

Bad error messages üëé:
```
"Error!"
"Invalid input"
"Wrong"
```

Good error messages üëç:
```
"Please enter a number between 1 and 3"
"Couldn't find the file. Make sure it's in your project folder!"
"That's not a number. Please try again!"
```

### 3. Testing Your Error Handling

Test your program by:
1. Typing letters when it wants numbers
2. Entering wrong menu choices
3. Trying to load files that don't exist
4. Entering negative numbers
5. Just pressing Enter without typing anything

### 4. Remember

- Always tell users what went wrong
- Give them a chance to try again
- Make your error messages friendly and helpful
- Test your program by trying to break it!
