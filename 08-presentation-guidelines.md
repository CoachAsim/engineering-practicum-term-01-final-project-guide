# Presentation Guidelines (5-Minute Presentation)

## 1. Introduction (1 minute)
- What problem did you investigate?
- What dataset did you use?
- What makes your analysis interactive?

## 2. Interactive Demo (2 minutes) - RECORD A VIDEO
- Show your program's main menu
- Demonstrate key interactive features
- Run a sample analysis
- Show how user input affects the analysis
- Display key visualizations

## 3. Code Walkthrough (1 minute)
- Show implementation of one interactive feature
- Highlight use of core programming concepts:
  * Show a loop structure
  * Demonstrate error handling
  * Point out data processing
  
## 4. Findings and Reflection (30 seconds)
- What did you discover about your data?
- How did making it interactive help analysis?
- What would you add with more time?

## 5. Q&A (30 seconds)
- Be ready to explain your code choices
- Prepare to demonstrate additional features
- Have your data insights ready

## Demo Tips

### Example Demo Flow
```
1. Start program
   "Let me show you how the program works..."

2. Load data
   "First, we'll load our dataset..."

3. Show menu
   "Here are the analysis options available..."

4. Run analysis
   "Let's analyze the top patterns in our data..."

5. Show visualization
   "This chart shows the key trends we found..."
```

### Technical Setup
- Test your demo beforehand
- Have data files ready
- Prepare backup screenshots
- Check visualization display

### Handling Questions
- "How did you handle invalid input?"
  * Show error handling code
  * Demonstrate with example

- "What was the most challenging feature?"
  * Explain technical challenge
  * Show how you solved it

- "How did you choose visualizations?"
  * Explain data types
  * Show visualization code
