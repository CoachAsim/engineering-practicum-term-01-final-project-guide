# High School Computer Science Final Project Guide

## Overview
During this 7-day project (1.5 hours each day), you'll create a program that analyzes real data related to your interests. While your finished project won't solve global challenges, it will demonstrate how programming and data analysis can be used to understand and address important problems.

## Project Scope
- Total time: 7 days Ã— 1.5 hours = 10.5 hours total
- One Python file (main.py) containing all code
- Analysis of one dataset
- At least two visualizations
- Clear documentation

## Example Projects

### For Clean Water Access Interest
Build a program that:
- Analyzes water quality data across different regions
- Creates visualizations showing access to clean water by location
- Calculates key statistics about water quality metrics
- Identifies areas most in need of clean water infrastructure

Example Features:
- Load and clean water quality datasets
- Create maps or charts showing water access patterns
- Calculate important metrics like population without access
- Generate reports highlighting critical areas

### For Audio Safety Interest
Build a program that:
- Analyzes audio level data from different environments
- Visualizes safe vs dangerous sound levels
- Identifies patterns in noise exposure
- Suggests safe listening durations

Example Features:
- Process decibel level datasets
- Create visualizations of sound exposure over time
- Calculate average exposure levels
- Generate safety recommendations

### For Transportation Systems Interest
Build a program that:
- Analyzes public transit usage data
- Visualizes peak travel times
- Identifies busy routes and stations
- Suggests service improvements

Example Features:
- Process transit ridership data
- Create charts showing usage patterns
- Calculate station capacity utilization
- Generate reports on system efficiency

### For Education Access Interest
Build a program that:
- Analyzes educational resource distribution
- Visualizes access to learning materials
- Identifies areas needing more resources
- Suggests resource allocation improvements

Example Features:
- Process education access datasets
- Create visualizations of resource distribution
- Calculate equity metrics
- Generate recommendations for improvement

## What You'll Actually Build
While these examples might sound ambitious, your project will be a focused version that demonstrates key concepts. For example, if you're interested in clean water access, you might:

1. Use a dataset of water quality measurements
2. Clean and process the data using Python
3. Calculate important statistics like:
   - Average quality metrics by region
   - Areas below safety thresholds
   - Population impact estimates
4. Create visualizations showing:
   - Quality metrics over time
   - Regional comparisons
   - Safety threshold violations
5. Generate a report with your findings and recommendations

The goal is to build something meaningful that:
- Uses real data related to your interests
- Demonstrates your programming skills
- Shows your data analysis capabilities
- Produces useful insights
