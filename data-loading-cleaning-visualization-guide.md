# Your Guide to Data Visualization: From Basics to Real Projects! 🐼 📊 ✨

Hey there! Ready to turn data into insights? Whether you're working on improving water quality, designing safer audio systems, or building assistive robots, this guide will help you visualize and understand your data. Let's start simple and build up to the cool stuff!

## Part 1: Getting Started - Your Data Journey 🚀

### How to Think About Your Analysis 🤔
Before diving into code, ask yourself:
1. What do I want to know about my data?
2. What kind of information would help answer my question?
3. What would the answer look like? (A number? A graph? A list?)

Example thought process:
```
Question: "Is the weather getting warmer?"
Think it through:
1. What info tells us about warmth? -> Temperature columns
2. How do we see change over time? -> Maybe a line plot
3. What would make it clear? -> Compare different years
```

## Part 2: Your First Data Analysis with Pandas 🐼

### Loading and Understanding Data
```python
# First, what do we need? 
import pandas as pd

# Load our weather data
weather = pd.read_csv('london_weather_edited.csv')

# What's in our data? Let's look!
print("First few rows:")
print(weather.head())

# What information do we have?
print("\nOur weather measurements:")
print(weather.columns)

# Quick summary of temperatures
print("\nTemperature summary:")
print(weather[['max_temp', 'mean_temp', 'min_temp']].describe())
```

### Understanding Your Data Better

#### Picking Quality Datasets 🔍
Before you start analyzing, make sure your data is good! Ask yourself:

1. Is it complete enough?
   - Has most of the important information
   - Not too many missing values
   - Covers a reasonable time period

2. Is it reliable?
   - Comes from a trustworthy source
   - Data makes logical sense (e.g., temperatures shouldn't be 1000°C!)
   - Values are in expected ranges

3. Is it relevant?
   - Helps answer your questions
   - Recent enough to be useful
   - Has the measurements you need

Quick Dataset Checkup:
```python
# 1. How much data do we have?
print(f"Total rows: {len(weather)}")
print(f"Total columns: {len(weather.columns)}")

# 2. What info do we have?
print("\nColumns in our data:")
print(weather.columns)

# 3. Quick overview of the data
print("\nData overview:")
print(weather.info())  # Shows data types and missing values

# 4. Check value ranges (are they reasonable?)
print("\nValue ranges:")
print(weather.describe())
```

#### Handling Missing Data 🛠️

Missing data can crash your program! Here's how to handle it:

1. First, find the missing values:
```python
# Check for missing values
missing_values = weather.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)

# Calculate percentage missing
percent_missing = (missing_values / len(weather)) * 100
print("\nPercentage missing:")
print(percent_missing)
```

2. Decide how to handle them:

Option 1: Remove rows with missing data
```python
# Remove any row that has missing data
clean_weather = weather.dropna()
print(f"Rows before: {len(weather)}")
print(f"Rows after: {len(clean_weather)}")
```

Option 2: Fill missing values
```python
# Fill missing values with column average
filled_weather = weather.fillna(weather.mean())

# Or fill with a specific value
filled_weather = weather.fillna(0)

# Or fill forward from previous value
filled_weather = weather.fillna(method='ffill')
```

Option 3: Fill different columns differently
```python
# Example: Different strategies for different columns
weather_fixed = weather.copy()
# Fill temperature with average
weather_fixed['max_temp'] = weather['max_temp'].fillna(weather['max_temp'].mean())
# Fill precipitation with 0 (assuming no rain recorded)
weather_fixed['precipitation'] = weather['precipitation'].fillna(0)
```

#### Tips for Good Data Practices 💡

1. Check your data first:
```python
# Quick data health check
def check_data_quality(df):
    print("=== Data Quality Report ===")
    print(f"\nTotal rows: {len(df)}")
    print(f"Total columns: {len(df.columns)}")
    
    print("\nMissing values:")
    print(df.isnull().sum())
    
    print("\nValue ranges:")
    print(df.describe())
    
    # Check for obvious errors (example with temperature)
    if 'max_temp' in df.columns:
        extreme_temps = df[df['max_temp'] > 50]  # Unlikely temp for London!
        if len(extreme_temps) > 0:
            print("\nWarning: Found suspicious temperatures!")
            print(extreme_temps)

# Use it on your data
check_data_quality(weather)
```

2. Document your cleaning choices:
```python
# Always note what you did to clean the data!
"""
Data Cleaning Steps:
1. Removed rows with missing temperatures
2. Filled missing precipitation with 0
3. Removed days with impossible values
"""

# Example cleaning pipeline
def clean_weather_data(df):
    cleaned = df.copy()  # Always work with a copy!
    
    # 1. Remove impossible values
    cleaned = cleaned[cleaned['max_temp'] < 50]  # No extreme temps
    
    # 2. Fill missing values
    cleaned['precipitation'] = cleaned['precipitation'].fillna(0)
    
    # 3. Remove remaining problems
    cleaned = cleaned.dropna(subset=['max_temp', 'min_temp'])
    
    print(f"Rows remaining: {len(cleaned)} of {len(df)}")
    return cleaned

# Clean your data
clean_weather = clean_weather_data(weather)
```

Remember:
- Always check your data before using it
- Document your cleaning steps
- Make sure your cleaning choices make sense for your project
- Keep a copy of the original data
- Test your cleaned data before analyzing

## Part 3: Making Your First Plots 📈

### Understanding Matplotlib and Seaborn 🎨

Think of plotting libraries like art supplies:

#### Matplotlib: Your Basic Art Kit 🖍️
- Like having pencils, paper, and rulers
- You control every little detail
- More code to write, but total control
- Good for: 
  * Simple plots
  * Custom visualizations
  * When you need precise control
  * Real-time data updates

```python
# Matplotlib example - You control everything
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))     # Create your canvas
plt.plot(weather['max_temp'])   # Draw your line
plt.title('Temperatures')       # Add your title
plt.xlabel('Days')             # Label x-axis
plt.ylabel('Temperature (°C)') # Label y-axis
plt.show()                     # Display it
```

#### Seaborn: Your Smart Art Kit 🎨
- Like having pre-made templates and special brushes
- Built on top of Matplotlib
- Fewer lines of code for pretty plots
- Good for:
  * Statistical visualizations
  * Complex plots made easy
  * Making things look nice quickly
  * When you have data in pandas DataFrames

```python
# Seaborn example - It handles many details for you
import seaborn as sns

# One line for a beautiful plot!
sns.scatterplot(data=weather, x='max_temp', y='sunshine')
plt.show()
```

#### When to Use Each? 🤔

Use Matplotlib when:
- You want complete control
- You're making simple line or bar plots
- You need to update plots in real-time
- You want to understand how plotting works

Use Seaborn when:
- You want pretty plots quickly
- You're doing statistical analysis
- You're working with pandas DataFrames
- You want to show relationships in data

Remember: Seaborn is built on Matplotlib, so you can mix them!
```python
# Using both together
sns.scatterplot(data=weather, x='max_temp', y='sunshine')
plt.title('My Custom Title')  # Adding Matplotlib title
plt.show()
```

### Basic Plot Types and When to Use Them:
- Line plots: Show changes over time
- Bar plots: Compare quantities
- Scatter plots: Show relationships
- Heatmaps: Show patterns in dense data
- Box plots: Show distributions and outliers

### Your First Temperature Plot
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple but informative plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(weather['max_temp'], color='red', label='Highest')
plt.plot(weather['min_temp'], color='blue', label='Lowest')
plt.title('Temperature Range Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Day')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (°C)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Making It Pretty with Seaborn
```python
import seaborn as sns

# Create an improved scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=weather,
                x='max_temp',
                y='sunshine',
                alpha=0.5)  # Makes points semi-transparent
plt.title('Temperature vs Sunshine Hours')
plt.xlabel('Maximum Temperature (°C)')
plt.ylabel('Hours of Sunshine')
plt.show()
```
